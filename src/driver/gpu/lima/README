This directory contains a port of the Linux DRM driver 'lima' for
Mali 400 series GPUs (Utgard).

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no policy management implemented and therefore each connecting
client is allowed to use the service. For the time being only one client
at a time is possible. Furthermore the 'Gpu' session does not make use of
accounting mechanisms, the driver has to provide all the resources the
client may need.


Usage
~~~~~

The driver will announce the 'Gpu' service after it successfully initialized
the GPU.

To start the driver the following configuration snippet can be used:

!<start name="lima_gpu" caps="500" ram="128M">
!  <provides> <service name="Gpu"/> </provides>
!  </config/>
!</start>

Additionally there exists the 'dtb' attribute in the '<config> node
that may be used to specify the name of the DTB ROM module, e.g.:

! <config dtb="lima-pinephone.dtb"/>
