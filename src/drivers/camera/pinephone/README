This directory contains a port of the Linux SUN6-CSI, GC2145 and
OV5640 camera drivers used in the PinePhone.


Usage
~~~~~

The driver renders its captured camera image data into a Gui session.
To start the driver the following configuration snippet can be used:

!<start name="pinephone_camera_drv" caps="500">
!  <resource name="RAM" quantum="16M"/>
!  <config width="640" height="480" fps="30" format="yuv"
!          convert="yes" rotate="yes"/>
!</start>

The :width: attribute selects the horizontal resolution and the :height:
attribute the vertical resolution. Valid configurations are '640x480'
as well as '1280x720'.

The :fps: attribute selects the capture rate of the camera. Valid values
are '15' and '30'.

The :format: attribute selects the capture format. The only valid value
is 'yuv', which selects YUV420.

The :convert: attribute specifies if the captured image data is converted
to the pixel format suitable for displaying directly. Default is 'true'.

The :rotate: attribute specifies if the capture image data is rotated
counter-clockwise and flipped. Default is 'true'.


Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

The YUV420 to ABGR conversion as well as the rotation of the resulting
picture is done in software on the CPU and comes with computational effort.
Thus the actual capture rate is expected to be lower then configured.
