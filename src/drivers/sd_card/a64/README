This directory contains a port of the Linux SUNXI-MMC driver for
SD/MMC controllers.


Limitiations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The eMMC module in the PinePhone is not initialized properly and
therefor is not usable. Furthermore SD card detection is not supported.


Usage
~~~~~

The driver will announce the 'Block' service for each successfully
initialized card.

To start the driver the following configuration snippet can be used:

!<start name="a64_sd_card_drv" caps="500">
!  <resource name="RAM" quantum="16M"/>
!  <provides> <service name="Block"/> </provides>
!  <config>
!    <default-policy device="mmcblk0" writeable="no"/>
!  </config>
!</start>


Additionally there exists the 'dtb' attribute in the '<config> node
that may be used to specify the name of the DTB ROM module, e.g.:

! <config dtb="sd_card-pinephone.dtb"/>
